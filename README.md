###Fast, secure and intuitive back-end framework

*__First__ in security, performance, simplicity and flexibility.*

__It really whips the secondsâ€™ ass!__

First off, Phastr is the fastest, security-first, Ajax driven back-end web application framework.

Every line of code is not only performant and functional but also aesthetically purposeful. This simple yet challenging rule is Phastr's only philosophy.

In essence Phastr is a framework to build frameworks, faster. The very meaning of efficiency in an absolute minimal footprint.

This framework was designed by and for creative coders and artists alike. It's syntax and semantics are nothing but the real thing.

Phastr does not try to reinvent the wheel and force you to relearn yet another language within a language within a language while stuffing you with arbitrary conventions or stripping you and the language out of the architectural decision making; leaving you both naked at the cost of performance. Sounds familiar? It's not by chance that this is what led to Phastr's existence.

If you're feeling creative you should be free to go ahead and use conventions and architectural patterns how you feel most appropriate. Phastr won't get in your way. Phastr tries to synthesize programming to its purest state wrapped in an intuitive hybrid MVC...............Ajax.

Phastr is more than a framework, it's in fact a modular library with everything you would expect. It's built for passionate programmers that do it like a boss and still have time to be creative. It's for real programmers or anyone who wants to learn real programming without pain; but it is certainly not pink. Well, unless you're happy with coding spaghetti. If you like the aroma of static declarations and similar shortcut brogramming methodologies then Phastr is not for you.

The result is making use of the low level [un]gracefulness of the language and all of its extent; the most efficiently possible. Keeping resources to an absolute minimum. The result is; well, what you see; graceful.
