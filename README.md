###Fast, secure and intuitive back-end framework

*__First__ in security, performance, simplicity and flexibility.*

__It really whips the secondsâ€™ ass!__

Phastr is the fastest, security-first, Ajax driven back-end web application framework.

Every line of code is not only optimally performant but also aesthetically consistent. This simple yet challenging rule is Phastr's only philosophy.

In essence Phastr is a framework to build frameworks, faster. Without the overhead in an absolute minimal footprint.

This framework was designed by and for creative coders and artists alike. It's syntax and semantics are nothing but the real thing.

Phastr does not try to reinvent the wheel and force you to relearn yet another language within a language within a language while stuffing you with arbitrary conventions and stripping you [and the language] out of architectural decision making; leaving you both naked at the cost of performance. Sounds familiar? It's not by chance that this is what led to Phastr's existence.

If you're feeling creative you should be free to go ahead and use conventions and architectural patterns how you feel most appropriate. Phastr won't get in your way. Phastr tries to synthesize programming to its purest state by wrapping its core in an intuitive hybrid MVC engine ready for running secure JavaScript applications.

Phastr is more than a framework, it's in fact a modular library with everything you would expect. It's built for passionate productive programmers that still want to be creative. It's for real programmers or anyone who wants to learn real programming without pain; but it is certainly not pink. Well, unless you're happy with coding spaghetti. If you like the aroma of static declarations and similar shortcut brogramming methodologies then Phastr is not for you.

Phastr uses the high-level [un]gracefulness of the language itself the most extensive and efficiently possible. This helps keeping resources to an absolute minimum. The result is; well, what you see, graceful.
