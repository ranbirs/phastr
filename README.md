###Fast, secure and intuitive back-end framework

*__First__ in security, simplicity, flexibility and performance.*

*It really whips the secondsâ€™ ass!*

First off, Phastr is the fastest badass back-end framework that is secured to its teeth (or anything you can think of) while still being enjoyable.

Every character in the source code is not only functional but aesthetically purposeful. This simple yet challenging rule is Phastr's only philosophy.

In essence Phastr is a framework to build frameworks, faster. The very meaning of efficiency in an absolute minimal footprint.

This framework was made by and for creative programmers; and artists alike. It's syntax and semantics are nothing but the real thing.

Phastr does not try to reinvent the wheel and force you to relearn yet another language within a language within a language while stuffing you with arbitrary conventions or stripping you and the language out of the architectural decision making; leaving you both naked at the cost of performance, yet all over again. Sounds familiar? It's not by chance that this is the greatest annoyance that led to Phastr's existence.

If you're feeling creative you should be free to go ahead and use conventions and architectural patterns how you feel most appropriate. Phastr won't get in your way. Phastr synthesizes programming to its purest state. Well, unless you're happy with coding spaghetti. If you like the aroma of static declarations and similar shortcut brogramming methodologies then Phastr is not for you.

Phastr is more than a framework, it's in fact modular a library with everything you would expect. It's for passionate programmers that do it like a boss and still have time to be creative. It's for real programmers or anyone who wants to learn real programming without much pain; but it is certainly not pink.

The result is making use the low level [un]gracefulness of the language in all of its extent, the most efficiently possible. Keeping resources to the absolute minimum. The result is; well, what you see; graceful.
