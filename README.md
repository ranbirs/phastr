###Fast, secure and intuitive back-end framework

*__First__ in security, performance, simplicity and flexibility.*

__It really whips the secondsâ€™ ass!__

Phastr is the fastest, security-first, JavaScript driven back-end web application framework.

Phastr is the web's NoMVC (Not only MVC) framework. Patterns such as MVC can be easily defined at the application level.

In essence Phastr is a framework to build frameworks, faster. Without the overhead in an absolute minimal footprint.

Every line of code is not only optimally performant but also aesthetically consistent. This simple yet challenging rule is Phastr's philosophy.

This framework was designed by and for creative coders and artists alike. It's syntax and semantics are nothing but the real thing.

Phastr does not try to reinvent the wheel and force you to relearn yet another language within a language within a language by stuffing you with arbitrary conventions and stripping you (and the language) out of architectural decision making; leaving you both naked at the cost of performance. Sounds familiar?

If you're feeling creative you should be free to go ahead and use conventions and architectural patterns how you feel most appropriate. Phastr won't get in your way.

Phastr's comes with an example MCV application ready for running secure JavaScript applications. The pattern is defined at the application level.

Phastr is more than a framework, it's in fact a modular library with everything you would expect, modules, components, handlers, etc.

Phastr uses the high-level (un)gracefulness of the language itself the most extensive and efficiently possible. For instance even the autoloader is default. This helps keeping resources to an absolute minimum. The result is; well, what you see, graceful.
